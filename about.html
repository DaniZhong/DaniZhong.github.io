        <h2 id="h2-about">My journey</h2>
        <p id="p-about">I graduated from South China University of Technoogy, major at Accounting and Application Software, where I studied software development courses including C language, programming basics, software engineering concepts, SDLC, etc.  I developed several software as part of the Uni programs.

            After graduation I joined Deloit and became an auditor. Then move on to be a financial consultant in Jade & Company.
            
            To follow my passion for software development I am now studing at the SHE CODES PLUS program. This program covers HTML/CSS, Python, Django, DRF, JavaScript and ReactJS, teach and guide by industry mentors. The program is heavily project based. There are projects for each modules and a group project.
