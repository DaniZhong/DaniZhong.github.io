                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <h5>Junior <span>full-stack developer</span></h5>
                    <p>I just graduated from the She Codes Plus Program, where I learned how to design, build and deploy websites using on-trend full-stack technology such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, React.js, Python, Django, and Git. Throughout the program, I developed several end-to-end applications: my portfolio, a news website, and a crowdfunding website, and we finalised the program with a group project. I am now actively looking for a development role. 

                        <br><br>I hold a bachelor's degree with honours, majoring in Accounting and Application Software. Besides accounting, I studied software development courses, such as C language, data structure, and software engineering/SDLC. I developed several applications as part of the Uni programs using C, FoxPro and Delphi.
                        
                        <br><br>After graduation from Uni, I joined Deloitte and became an auditor, then moved on to be a senior consultant at Jade & Company. I gain extensive business knowledge and analytical, problem-solving and stakeholder engagement skills from experiences in consultancy and external auditing for MNCs spanning multiple sectors.

                        <br><br>To follow my passion for software development, I joined the SHE CODES PLUS program after taking time to focus on the family. And I now keep self-studying while applying for jobs to work toward being a full-stack developer.

                            This is my first website that showcases my portfolio. I used HTML and CSS to build the website. It has evolved along my learning journey in the She Codes Plus program, from basic static pages to a modern website powered by amazing CSS effects. I am loving it!

                            This news website has features such as registering as a user, displaying, viewing, posting and searching news, basic implementation for user authentication, and API permission. I enjoy the “Model-View-Template” (MVT) structure provided by the Django framework. It helps me to integrate data easily into the UI.

                            Leveraging all the tech skills I learned in the She Codes Plus program (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django), I built this E2E crowdfunding solution- “Smile for All”. This website provides a platform for community members to create and display projects for dental needs they could not afford and for supporters to make pledges to help to restore smiles.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In this group project, the team create a social media website for the community to create and show profiles to promote diversity in tech. I took on the challenge of building the E2E solution for Viewing all profiles with a filtering function and viewing individual profile details. I fully integrated my React skill and Django skill into the solution.
